Bookmark Manager
This week, you will build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

The project
You're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

User stories
As a user So that I can access my frequently visited websites I want to see a list of bookmarks

As a user So that I can save a frequently visited website I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager

As a user So I can save a new bookmark I would like to add a bookamrk to the original list of bookmarks

Database table setup
To create the database please do the following:

Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the psql command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
Database bookmark_manager_test setup
Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE "bookmark_manager_test";
Connect to the database using the psql command \c bookmark_manager_test;
Create a table using the command CREATE TABLE bookmarks(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, url VARCHAR(60));




(The same task as my bookmark-manager repo but done alone for learning purposes.)
